*Basic steps:*

- Install Java and supporting tools
    - Install Java JDK ( Preferred version is either 11 or 8 )
    - Install Maven ( Preferred version should be  >= 3.6.0 ) 
    - Check Java and Maven work by running a sample test
- Install IntelliJ
    - Check IntelliJ works by running the sample test
        
This checklist contains instructions for Windows and Mac.

## Check what you need to install

*  Check what you need to install by typing console commands : 
    *  javac -version
          - if it fails then you need to install a Java JDK
    *  mvn -version
          - if it fails then you need to install maven

*  Run this command : `brew update` 
*  Install jdk with : `brew cask install java`
*  Install maven with : `brew install maven`

* If everything is installed, check the environment variables by displaying them on the console
    * For Mac type : 
        * `echo $JAVA_HOME`

* Download JUnit Test Project (this has a simple pom.xml and a basic test to run)
    *  Visit this url : https://github.com/ramgsuri/JavaForQa.git
    *  Download the zip file and unzip somewhere

*  run my first test from the command line
    *  use the command line to "cd" to the directory you unarchived the source code to
    * Run the following command : `mvn test`

If it runs successfully then you have Java and Maven Installed on Mac.

## Install IntelliJ Community Edition on Mac 

You can install IntelliJ using Homebrew as well by typing:

*  `brew cask install intellij-idea-ce`

Or you can install it like a normal Mac application using the instructions below.

*  Install IntelliJ IDE Community Edition,
    * visit the web site https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ 
    * download and install the Community Edition
    
* Open the 'start-using-java' project in IntelliJ and run the test from the IDE to ensure IntelliJ and JDK and Maven are all working together.
